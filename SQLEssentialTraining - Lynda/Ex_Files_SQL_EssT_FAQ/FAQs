Q: When I download XAMPP from bw.org/ldcsql using Windows I get a message telling me that 
the file is corrupt or invalid. 

A: This is a known issue with the latest versions of Microsoft's web browsers. It flags 
any code signed before 2016 as invalid. The file is not corrupt and you may download and 
install it. If you wish to avoid the error message, I suggest you use Chrome or another 
third-party browser.
